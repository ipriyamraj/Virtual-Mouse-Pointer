For Hand Tracking Module

This Python script uses the MediaPipe library and OpenCV to detect and track hands in a video stream from a webcam. 
The script defines a "handDetector" class that has methods to find hands in an image and extract their landmarks, 
calculate the positions of fingers, and find the distance between two points on a hand. The "main" function reads 
frames from the webcam, processes them using the "handDetector" class, and displays the frames with the detected 
hand landmarks and other information.


Requirements:-

PyCharm Community Edition 2022.2.1
Python 3.7 
OpenCV 4.2 or higher
MediaPipe 0.8.3 or higher


Installation:-

Clone the repository or download the script.
Install the required libraries using pip:
pip install opencv-python mediapipe

Run the script using the command:
python hand_detection.py

Place your hand in front of the webcam and move it around to see the hand detection and tracking in action.


Customization:-
You can customize the behavior of the script by changing the parameters of the "handDetector" class. 
For example, you can change the maximum number of hands to detect, the confidence threshold for detection 
and tracking, and the indices of the finger landmarks.
